{# If you've come here you must be curious, and willing to dig deeper.
This is not just plain html. We are using something called jinja
Jinja is an html templating language. It will write your html for you
based off of variables you passed it when you called 'render_template'
Things in curly braces are jinja. Things in angle brackets are html.
Don't worry, it's not too complicated! #}

{# This is a comment, in case you haven't figured that out already #}

{# The html generated from this file will get knitted together with the html
generated from layout.html #}

    {# This creates an html list from the python list named space #}
